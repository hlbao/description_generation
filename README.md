# DataReader
1. Data Reader is a program that reads data items from a files (here linguistic corpora, perticularly wikipedia extractor sets) into machine learning + evolutionary computation program, and creates training/testing examples. This part of the project is just to make sure that you find your actual data and have a program that can interact with your data: Read the data from a folders/files and have your data items in the form of learning examples. Depending on how clean/structured is your data this step might need a bit of work for you.

2. Notice in this data-reader repository, we just focus on the reading+mining of data from wiki. It definitely needs more efforts to do cleaning or structured operations. So far we have not implemented that, but we will work on this during the entire cycle of this project.

3. This repository included two parts, the first is a Wikipedia crawler. The second one is mining and pre-processing. The output should be named with 'wikiextractor/extracted/originaltext', and stored within the same root-folder.
